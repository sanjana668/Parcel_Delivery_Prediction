# Parcel_Delivery_Prediction
This project analyzes Porter’s 2023 parcel delivery data using EDA and regression to predict delivery times. It helps optimize routes, improve fleet management, and provide accurate ETAs, boosting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in urban logistics.

**Parcel Delivery Time Prediction Project**

**Purpose:**
This project focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling techniques to Porter’s 2023 parcel delivery dataset. The objective is to discover meaningful patterns and develop accurate models that predict delivery times. By doing so, logistics companies can optimize their operations, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance profitability in a highly competitive urban delivery market.

**Why it matters:**
The logistics industry, especially intra-city delivery, faces numerous challenges including fluctuating demand, traffic variability, and diverse parcel characteristics. Porter serves millions of customers daily, making efficient and timely deliveries critical to maintaining a competitive edge. Accurate delivery time predictions enable the company to:
1. Optimize route planning and fleet management for timely deliveries
2. Assign and schedule delivery partners more effectively to meet demand
3. Provide reliable estimated delivery times (ETAs) that manage customer expectations
4. Reduce delays and minimize operational costs through better planning
5. Enhance the overall delivery experience, leading to improved customer loyalty

**Tools Used:**
The project leverages powerful data analysis and machine learning tools including:
1. Python as the primary programming language
2. Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing
3. Scikit-learn and XGBoost for building and fine-tuning predictive regression models
4. Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for insightful data visualization
5. Jupyter Notebook to enable interactive data exploration and model evaluation

**Key Outcomes:**
The analysis reveals key factors influencing delivery times such as distance, traffic conditions, package weight, and time of day. Using these insights, Porter can:
1. Improve the accuracy of delivery time predictions to better manage operations
2. Enhance fleet efficiency by optimizing delivery routes and schedules
3. Make data-driven decisions that reduce costs and increase profitability
4. Provide customers with trustworthy delivery estimates, boosting satisfaction and retention

**Big Picture:**
By harnessing real-world delivery data and predictive analytics, Porter can strategically navigate the complexities of urban logistics. This data-driven approach empowers the company to adapt quickly to changing conditions, maintain high service quality, and remain competitive in a fast-evolving market landscape.
